'''
One-time interactive login for the boxed.gg gem-drop claimer.

Run this once (and again only when the session expires). It opens a real,
visible Chrome window using a persistent profile directory. You log in by hand:
email + password, plus any captcha or Cloudflare check the site throws up. When
you close the window, Chrome has already written the resulting cookies and
localStorage into PROFILE_DIR, so watch.py can reuse the session without ever
touching your password.

If boxed.gg's login goes through Google OAuth, this script's browser may hit
Google's "this browser or app may not be secure" block: Google refuses OAuth
sign-in in any browser launched with DevTools/CDP attached, which is how
Playwright starts Chrome even with navigator.webdriver spoofed. If that
happens, log in with a plain, non-automated Chrome pointed at the same
profile directory instead, then close it:

    "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe" ^
        --user-data-dir="<repo>\\boxedGemWatcher\\browserProfile" https://boxed.gg/

Since PROFILE_DIR is just an on-disk Chrome profile, the cookies it writes
are picked up by watch.py identically either way.

Usage:
    python login.py
